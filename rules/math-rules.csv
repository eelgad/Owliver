*sqrt*,"The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number."
*power*,Raising a number to a power means multiplying it by itself a specified number of times.
*factorial*,The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.
*modulo*,Modulo operation returns the remainder when one number is divided by another.
*log*,The logarithm of a number is the power to which a base must be raised to produce that number.
*sin*,The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle.
*cos*,The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle.

*equation*,"An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal, containing one or more variables."
*integral*,Integration is a mathematical operation used to find the area under a curve or the accumulation of quantities.
*derivative*,Derivatives measure how a function changes as its input changes.
*solve*,Solving an equation means finding the values of variables that make the equation true.
*factor*,Factoring means breaking down an expression into simpler parts that multiply together.
*linear equation*,A linear equation is an equation in which the variables appear only to the first power and are not multiplied together.
